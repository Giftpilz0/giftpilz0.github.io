Microsoft Key Management Service (KMS) is a critical component of efficient license management for Microsoft products. KMS allows organizations to activate and manage licenses for their Microsoft software in a centralized manner, ensuring compliance and simplifying the deployment of licensed software across the network. With KMS, administrators can automate license activation, reducing the administrative burden and ensuring that software remains properly licensed throughout its lifecycle.
