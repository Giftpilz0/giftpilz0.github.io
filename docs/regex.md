Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a powerful pattern-matching language used for searching, extracting, and manipulating text based on user-defined patterns. It provides a concise and flexible way to describe and match character sequences within strings. Regex is invaluable for tasks like data validation, text parsing, and search-and-replace operations, offering a versatile toolset for working with textual data in programming and text-processing tasks.
