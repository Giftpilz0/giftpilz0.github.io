Vagrant is an open-source tool for managing and provisioning virtualized development environments. It simplifies the process of setting up and configuring reproducible development environments, allowing developers to work in consistent and isolated environments across various platforms. With Vagrant, users can define their development environment specifications in code, making it easier to share and collaborate on projects. Vagrant supports various virtualization providers, such as VirtualBox, VMware, and Libvirt, and offers a wide range of pre-configured boxes for different operating systems and development stacks.
