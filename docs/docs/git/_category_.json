    "description": "Git is a distributed version control system designed to manage source code and track changes efficiently. It allows multiple contributors to collaborate on software projects, maintaining a complete history of code modifications. Git's decentralized architecture enables developers to work offline, create branches for new features or bug fixes, and merge changes seamlessly. It's an indispensable tool for tracking, sharing, and managing code throughout the development lifecycle."
