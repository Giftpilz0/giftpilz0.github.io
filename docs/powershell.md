PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft, designed to automate administrative tasks and manage system configurations. It offers a robust set of tools and cmdlets (commands) for performing a wide range of tasks, from simple file operations to complex system administration tasks. PowerShell's scripting capabilities enable the creation of reusable automation scripts, making it a preferred choice for system administrators and developers in Windows environments. Its extensibility and integration with other Microsoft technologies make it a versatile tool for managing and maintaining Windows-based systems.
