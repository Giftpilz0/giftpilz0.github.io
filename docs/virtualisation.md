Virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of multiple virtual instances, such as virtual machines (VMs) or virtual networks, on a single physical hardware infrastructure. It abstracts and isolates computing resources, allowing for efficient resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility. Virtualization is used extensively in data centers, cloud computing, and desktop environments, enabling businesses to optimize resource allocation, streamline management, and enhance overall system resilience and performance.
